<p class="lead">Introduction</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer_lending">Peer-to-peer lending</a>
is a relatively new form of financing, from the people to the people. One of the first, and currently largest,
such lending platforms is <a href="https://www.lendingclub.com/">Lending Club</a>.
Click <a href="https://www.lendingclub.com/public/how-peer-lending-works.action">here</a>
for more information about Lending Club and how democratized lending works.
<p></p>
Lending Club and other platforms generally have an "Auto-Invest" option to allow
investors to minimally manage their investment. Lending Club, for instance, allows one
to choose a distribution of loan grades in which to invest. However, choosing a distribution
to optimize returns is <b>not trivial or obvious</b>. This is the reason Machine Lending was developed.
<p></p>
The term <i>Machine Lending</i> is ment to describe the fact that the
loan default predictions on this site are calculated using
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The model used to make the predictions
is constantly evolving and improving. See the <a href="#methods">Methods</a> for more details.

<p class="lead">Data</p>
<a name="data"></a>
As any good and transparent corporation would do, Lending Club has made a large amount of historical
data <a href="https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action">available</a>.
This data ranges from interest rate and FICO score to the number of months since the borrower was
delinquent and their <a href="http://www.creditcards.com/glossary/term-revolving-balance.php">revolving balance</a>.
Crucially, it also includes the current state of the loan. This means one can see if a loan
was paid in full, charged off, or current. That information is used as the dependent variable
when creating the Lending Club model. Everything else is used to train the models to predict loan default rate.
<p></p>
In addition to historical data, Lending Club also provides information about the current loans that
require funding via their <a href="https://www.lendingclub.com/developers/lc-api.action">API</a>. This enables
algorithmic prediction and purchase of the cream of the crop loans.

To make loan default predictions, Machine Lending uses what is called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning">ensemble learning</a>.
In short, take a set of the appropriate machine learning algorithms and optimize
their coordination to fit the historical data as best possible. It's a
"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds">wisdom of crowds</a>"
approach to a democratized lending platform.
Another way to think of it is meta-classification. The source code for the
in-house meta classifier is available on
