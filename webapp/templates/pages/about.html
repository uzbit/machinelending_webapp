  <h1>About Machine Lending</h1>
</div>
<p class="lead">Introduction</p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer_lending">Peer-to-peer lending</a>
is a relatively new form of financing, from the people to the people. One of the first, and currently largest,
such lending platforms is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lendingclub.com/">Lending Club</a>.
More information about Lending Club and democratized lending can be found
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.lendingclub.com/public/how-peer-lending-works.action">here</a>.
<p></p>
Lending Club and other platforms generally have an "Auto-Invest" option to allow
investors to minimally manage their investment. Lending Club, for instance, allows one
to choose a distribution of loan grades in which to invest. However, choosing loans from a distribution of grades
to optimize returns is <b>not trivial or obvious</b>. This is the reason Machine Lending was developed.
<p></p>
The term <i>Machine Lending</i> is ment to describe the fact that the
loan default predictions on this site are calculated using
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The model used to make the predictions
is constantly evolving and improving. See the <a target="_blank" href="#methods">Methods</a> for more details.

<p class="lead">Data</p>
<a name="data"></a>
As any good and transparent corporation would do, Lending Club has made a large amount of historical
data <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action">available</a>.
This data ranges from interest rate and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FICO">FICO</a>
score to the number of months since the borrower was
delinquent and their <a target="_blank" href="http://www.creditcards.com/glossary/term-revolving-balance.php">revolving balance</a>.
Crucially, it also includes the current state of the loan. This means one can see if a loan
was paid in full, charged off, or current. That information is used as the dependent variable
when creating the Lending Club model. Everything else is used to train the models to predict loan default rate.
<p></p>
In addition to historical data, Lending Club also provides information about the current loans that
require funding via their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lendingclub.com/developers/lc-api.action">API</a>. This enables
algorithmic prediction and purchase of the cream-of-the-crop notes.

To make loan default predictions, Machine Lending uses what is called
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning">ensemble learning</a>.
In short, take a set of the appropriate machine learning algorithms and optimize
their coordination to fit the historical data as best possible. It's a
"<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds">wisdom of crowds</a>"
approach to machine learning. This approach of combining the predictions of different algorithms is generally the winning
solution to black-box style machine learning competions, such as the

Machine Lending uses an optimized linear combination of predictions from the following algorithms:<br>

<p class="lead">Results</p>
<a name="results"></a>
A commonly used metric to determine the performance of a binary classifier is the area under the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic">Receiver Operating Characteristic</a> (ROC) curve.
Generally, a classifier has an area under the curve (auc) somewhere between 0.5 and 1.0. Values closer to 1.0 indicate stronger
predictive power. Below is a plot of the current ROC curve for the Machine Lending classifier, with auc = 0.9. Plotted is the mean (red)
and ± 3*σ (blue) ROC curves for 50 fold training cross-validation sets.
