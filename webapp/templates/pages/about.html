<p class="lead">Introduction</p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer_lending">Peer-to-peer lending</a>
is a relatively new form of financing, from the people to the people. One of the first, and currently largest,
such lending platforms is <a href="https://www.lendingclub.com/">Lending Club</a>.
Click <a href="https://www.lendingclub.com/public/how-peer-lending-works.action">here</a>
for more information about Lending Club and how democratized lending works.
<p></p>
Lending Club and other platforms generally have an "Auto-Invest" option to allow
investors to minimally manage their investment. Lending Club, for instance, allows one
to choose a distribution of loan grades in which to invest. However, choosing a distribution
to optimize returns is <b>not trivial or obvious</b>. This is the reason Machine Lending was developed.
<p></p>
The term <i>Machine Lending</i> is ment to describe the fact that the
loan default predictions on this site are calculated using
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The model used to make the predictions
is constantly evolving and improving. See the <a href="#methods">Methods</a> for more details.

<p class="lead">Data</p>
<a name="data"></a>
As any good and transparent orginization would do, Lending Club has made a large amount of historical
data <a href="https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action">available</a>.
This data ranges from interest rate and FICO score to the number of months since the borrower was
delinquent and their <a href="http://www.creditcards.com/glossary/term-revolving-balance.php">revolving balance</a>.
Crucially, it also includes the current state of the loan. This means one can see if a loan
was paid in full, charged off, or current. That information is used as the dependent variable
when creating the Lending Club model. Everything else is used to train the models to predict loan default rate.
